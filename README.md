# Simple Apache server deployment

This is an example of deployment of Apache deployment started via OCCI on EGI FedCloud. Service deployment is managed by custom
Puppet interface which supports r10k (Puppetfile), Hiera bindings
and access to Cloudify context (ctx). Tested on CentOS 7.x.

This example was prepared for purposes of *Cloud Orchestration Training* organized by MU within H2020 West-Life project (http://about.west-life.eu/).
For deployment instructions follow steps described at http://internal-wiki.west-life.eu/w/index.php?title=Cloud_Orchestration_Training .
